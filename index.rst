The IAC protocol
================

The IAC (*inter-application communication*) protocol is a protocol that enables inter-application communication and scripting. 

Have you ever wanted to program or script something using the internal functionality of a program, such as a document or spreadsheet program? This interface and protocol specification lets you do just that!

Create the automation scripts of your dreams, and contribute to the growing body of supported programs.
